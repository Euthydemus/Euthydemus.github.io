A recent article in <em>Fast Company</em> asserts that "Meritocracy has become a leading social ideal," 
noting by way of definition that "Under meritocracy, wealth and advantage are merit’s rightful 
compensation, not the fortuitous windfall of external events."

<span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40510522/meritocracy-doesnt-exist-and-believing-it-does-is-bad-for-you">Mark, 2019</a></span>
The article is mostly involved in how "the belief that merit rather than luck determines success 
or failure in the world is demonstrably false," relying on Frank's <em>Success and Luck</em> but
my reference point would be Jo Freeman's "<a href="https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm">The 
Tyranny of Structurelessness</a>" that focuses on how social behaviors are emergent even when not
codified. Or, to the point, a shameless self-promoter will engage in shameless self-promotion of
their meritless ideas and--lacking the possibly-prejudicial social norms that might have validated
merit--have a local advantage over their more value-focused peers.

This is fundamentally a version of Goodhart's Law: {{ site.data.cards.axioms.goodhart.text }}
<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"><a href="{{ site.data.cards.axioms.goodhart.xref }}">Wikipedia Entry</a></span>
in that a person who knows what sort of self-promotion gets rewarded can expect to focus on 
self-promotion activities to the detriment of their actual responsibilities and still be
lavishly rewarded compared to responsible workers who neglect self-promotion activities,
expecting that their work will be a suitable testament to their skill. It will not: the
skilled corporate ladder-climber will boast of being "on the team" that delivered the valuable
work and also uniquely brag about how they uniquely influenced some other part of the organization,
clearly outperforming the people who were merely on the team. (While Goodhart was focused
on economic policy, his formulation was a reduction of Cambpell's Law: {{ site.data.cards.axioms.campbell.text }}<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

This is where we get into the Peter Principle: {{ site.data.cards.axioms.peter.text }}

Having successfully punched their way up a few organizational levels, the ladder-climber is going
to plateau. Stuck in tightening competitions with other opportunist ladder-climbers and also
perhaps the few people with the skills and experience that actually do merit their position,
the ladder-climber's abilities are revealed to be non-unique and paper-thin. 

The deep irony of the Peter Principle in a meritocracy is that a person's compensation increases
after they've fininshed making their contributions, real or imaginary, and their compensation is
likely to be highest when they are damaging the organization with either accidental ineptitude
or out of peevish spite.

See, lacking any strength to punch up the organizational hierarchy further, the canny ladder-climber,
well aware that the Peter Principle applies to them as well, will start <em>punching down</em> 
to mitigate threats from high-performing employees. This gives us Pournelle's Iron Law of 
Bureaucracy: {{ site.data.cards.axioms.pournelle.text }}

For the brazenly-careerist neoliberal ladder-climber, the purpose of the organization is to give
them power and socioeconomic standing and if the organization has to be undermined for the individual
to defend their position, then that's what happens.

There is a worrisome echo of Peter Principle self-awareness in Arendt's <em>The Origins of
Totalitarianism</em>:
<blockquote>
<p>{{ site.data.cards.arendt.totalitarianism.cards[0].text}}</p>
<footer>{{ site.data.cards.arendt.totalitarianism.cards[0].cite }}</footer>
</blockquote>
That is: when a person is aware that their high-status position is not wholly deserved, they'll
readily punch down into the organization to defend their position to the detriment of the organization,
in a manner wholly consistent with Stalin.

While modern corporate re-organizations and headcount reductions pale in comparison to Stalin's work,
it is worth noting that a learned helplessness emerges from the populace:
<blockquote>
<p>{{ site.data.cards.arendt.totalitarianism.cards[1].text}}</p>
<footer>{{ site.data.cards.arendt.totalitarianism.cards[1].cite }}</footer>
</blockquote>
And when the leader's purpose behind their seemingly idiotic cruelty is to make their position
unassailable, the damage done to the organization is indistinguishable from sabotage.

On a smaller scale than Stalin, the ladder-climbing careerist can re-organize their department to
neutralize any theats, often while reminding employees that "You own your career" but that "Change
is the only constant." Those who stop to think about this will realize that changes are kind of
like mutations: not all of them are really evolution, a lot of them are just cancer. The lazy point
behind stoking change rather than trying to shield working teams from it is to allow an ongoing
sense of crisis to narrow employees' vision.

Fraser abstracts the leadership-inflicted organizational crisis pattern as the Hegemonic Crisis:
<blockquote>
<p>Hegemonic crisis is about the sudden collapse of interpretive frames, value horizons, 
and psychic investments, all of which had previously worked together to suture gaps in the 
social-political universe. At this level, crisis is first and foremost about <em>disaffiliation</em>. 
It involves withdrawal from established loyalties, party memberships, and commonsense world-views. 
The mass psychology of hegemonic crisis consists in being set adrift, being disoriented and 
disconnected. It is a hard, uncomfortable placed to inhabit. And it’s not in the long run 
sustainable. On the contrary, hegemonic crisis is necessarily lived as an interregnum, a way 
station en route to some new dispensation: a new worldview, a new set of affiliations, new 
political loyalties and existential investments.</p>
<footer>Fraser, 2019</footer>
</blockquote>
To be fair, some hegemonic crises are normal: a necessary re-alignment of business to market
objectives, or when a company is bought out, or when career pursuits require moving to a
new city. Extracting oneself from the status quo and all that was expected to continue for
the sake of transplanting it into a new context is always going to be rough. The problems
arise when the hegemonic forces don't recognize the magnitude of crises they're inflicting
so they don't think twice about inflicting more of them and, in so doing, prevent recovery.

The exit from a hegemonic crisis is the acceptance of the new context as signaled by--to follow
Fraser's lead--committing to a new set of affiliations, loyalties, and investments. If,
however, the cadence of crises results in a crisis-ordinary situation, then we should be
unsurprised to see continued disaffiliation with the appearance of individuals' performative
continuity being fueled only by cruel optimism.

Chun describes Berlant's theory of Cruel Optimism thusly:
<blockquote>
<p>{{ site.data.cards.chun.updating.cards[0].text }}</p>
<footer>{{ site.data.cards.chun.updating.cards[0].cite }}</footer>
</blockquote>
This is what happens when workers just have to roll with the punches that their leaders do not
protect them from or actively inflict upon them. The disaffiliation that is normal in a
hegemonic crisis is going to become a culture of disengagement that persists even after the
hegemonic crises, plural, have passed. Once people have been inadvertently convinced that
effort is in fact not worth the effort, reversing that learning is very difficult.

Thus the damage cruel optimism does to an organization is that it eliminates the capacity for
strategic vision at the tactical level. After all, considering the recent cadence of reorganizations
and layoffs, who really expects to see the glorious new 3-year plan come to fruition? Even if the
Peter-Principled managerial staff had a strategy instead of just a word-cloud from HBR articles,
their refusal to sacrifice anything at all for the sake of the people they expect to actually
pursue the strategy and achieve its goals for the sake of the organization shows how ill-gotten
their position is.

One side effect of this is Conway's Law: {{ site.data.cards.axioms.conway.text }}

Put another way, the more team boundaries get crossed in designing a functional piece of software,
the less coherent the software design is going to be. For our purposes, though, we see that
chronic hegemonic crises occurring over the development of a piece of software will make it a
miracle if anything ever gets delivered much less works in a reasonable or useful fashion.

Another broader impace of this is that meritocracy replaces itself with survivorship bias.
The iconic example of this in action is "Neutron Jack" Welch, former CEO of GE. "Welch earned the 
name “Neutron Jack” for his slash-and-burn management style, where he constantly eliminated... the 
bottom 10% of executives and other workers" (Schwartz &amp; Gasparino, 2018) and "divested and laid
off almost as much as he acquired... leaving empty buildings in his wake and earning him the name
Neutron Jack" (Phelan, 2012), a behavior that clearly
incentivizes infighting in the lower ranks. The fundamental problem is that survivorship bias is 
not a substitute for meritocracy, a point that Jack noticed much too late: "in private, Welch places 
most of the blame for the company’s problems on his hand-picked successor. Welch is said to believe 
that Immelt did not have the chops to run the company’s core businesses..." (Schwartz &amp; Gasparino, 2018),
which is not a claim that Welch is allowed to retroactively make about his hand-picked successor.
Welch's chronic, caustic meritocracy resulted in there being nobody able to replace him when the
time came. There may be multiple reasons for this--Welch's GE was an incoherent conglomorate mess
regardless of its stock valuation or anybody's ability to maintain it, for example--but Jack's
leadership style was consistent through his tenure, his selection of successor, and his handoff.

Looking for alternatives, Simon Sinek, skilled remixer of historical knowledge, explains that sacrifice is a necessary
component of leadership<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP38Cxve5xY">YouTube Video</a></span>,
but that the people running organizations will do anything but sacrifice themselves, but he doesn't
talk about how they go astray despite the obvious consequences of their behaviors. And, despite the
obvious consequences of their behaviors, they will behave in this way because they care more about
themselves than they do about the organization.
