A recent article in <em>Fast Company</em> asserts that "Meritocracy has become a leading social ideal," 
noting by way of definition that "Under meritocracy, wealth and advantage are merit’s rightful 
compensation, not the fortuitous windfall of external events."

<span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40510522/meritocracy-doesnt-exist-and-believing-it-does-is-bad-for-you">Mark, 2019</a></span>
The article is mostly involved in how "the belief that merit rather than luck determines success 
or failure in the world is demonstrably false," relying on Frank's <em>Success and Luck</em> but
my reference point would be Jo Freeman's "<a href="https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm">The 
Tyranny of Structurelessness</a>" that focuses on how social behaviors are emergent even when not
codified. Or, to the point, a shameless self-promoter will engage in shameless self-promotion of
their meritless ideas and--lacking the possibly-prejudicial social norms that might have validated
merit--have a local advantage over their more value-focused peers.

This is fundamentally a version of Goodhart's Law: {{ site.data.cards.axioms.goodhart.text }}
<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"><a href="{{ site.data.cards.axioms.goodhart.xref }}">Wikipedia Entry</a></span>
in that a person who knows what sort of self-promotion gets rewarded can expect to focus on 
self-promotion activities to the detriment of their actual responsibilities and still be
lavishly rewarded compared to responsible workers who neglect self-promotion activities,
expecting that their work will be a suitable testament to their skill. It will not: the
skilled corporate ladder-climber will boast of being "on the team" that delivered the valuable
work and also uniquely brag about how they uniquely influenced some other part of the organization,
clearly outperforming the people who were merely on the team.

This is where we get into the Peter Principle: {{ site.data.cards.axioms.peter.text }}
<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"><a href="{{ site.data.cards.axioms.peter.xref }}">Wikipedia Entry</a></span>
Having successfully punched their way up a few organizational levels, the ladder-climber is going
to plateau. Stuck in tightening competitions with other opportunist ladder-climbers and also
perhaps the few people with the skills and experience that actually do merit their position,
the ladder-climber's abilities are revealed to be non-unique and paper-thin. 

The deep irony of the Peter Principle in a meritocracy is that a person's compensation increases
after they've fininshed making their contributions, real or imaginary, and their compensation is
likely to be highest when they are damaging the organization with either accidental ineptitude
or out of peevish spite.

See, lacking any strength to punch up the organizational hierarchy further, the canny ladder-climber,
well aware that the Peter Principle applies to them as well, will start <em>punching down</em> 
to mitigate threats from high-performing employees. This gives us Pournelle's Iron Law of 
Bureaucracy: {{ site.data.cards.axioms.pournelle.text }}

For the brazenly-careerist neoliberal ladder-climber, the purpose of the organization is to give
them power and socioeconomic standing and if the organization has to be undermined for the individual
to defend their position, then that's what happens.

There is a worrisome echo of Peter Principle self-awareness in Arendt's <em>The Origins of
Totalitarianism</em>:
<blockquote>
<p>{{ site.data.cards.arendt.totalitarianism.cards[0].text}}</p>
<footer>{{ site.data.cards.arendt.totalitarianism.cards[0].cite }}</footer>
</blockquote>
That is: when a person is aware that their high-status position is not wholly deserved, they'll
readily punch down into the organization to defend their position to the detriment of the organization,
in a manner wholly consistent with Stalin.

While modern corporate re-organizations and headcount reductions pale in comparison to Stalin's work,
it is worth noting that a learned helplessness emerges from the populace:
<blockquote>
<p>{{ site.data.cards.arendt.totalitarianism.cards[1].text}}</p>
<footer>{{ site.data.cards.arendt.totalitarianism.cards[1].cite }}</footer>
</blockquote>
And when the leader's purpose behind their seemingly idiotic cruelty is to make their position
unassailable, the damage done to the organization is indistinguishable from sabotage.

On a smaller scale than Stalin, the ladder-climbing careerist can re-organize their department to
neutralize any theats, often while reminding employees that "You own your career" but that "Change
is the only constant." Those who stop to think about this will realize that changes are kind of
like mutations: not all of them are really evolution, a lot of them are just cancer. The lazy point
behind stoking change rather than trying to shield working teams from it is to allow an ongoing
sense of crisis to narrow employees' vision.

Perhaps you've finished developing one user story and find that there's another user story to work
on, so-called iteration after so-called iteration with no tangible customer value in sight. That's
not how Agile Development is supposed to work, but the endlessly renewed pile of little tasks is
extremely conducive to fomenting a cruel optimism in software developers.

Chun describes Berlant's theory of Cruel Optimism thusly:
<blockquote>
<p>{{ site.data.cards.chun.updating.cards[0].text }}</p>
<footer>{{ site.data.cards.chun.updating.cards[0].cite }}</footer>
</blockquote>
This is what happens when workers just have to roll with the punches that their leaders do not
protect them from. The modern large organization can rely on cruel optimism to help maintain a
status quo: employees have debts to pay, kids to raise, and can't just pack up and pursue an
economic opportunity that isn't matched by similar for their spouse.

But the real harm to cruel optimism in an organization is that it eliminates the capacity for
strategic vision at the tactical level. After all, considering the recent cadence of reorganizations
and layoffs, who really expects to see the glorious new 3-year plan come to fruition? Even if the
Peter-Principled managerial staff had a strategy instead of just a word-cloud from HBR articles,
their refusal to sacrifice anything at all for the sake of the people they expect to actually
pursue the strategy and achieve its goals for the sake of the organization shows how ill-gotten
their position is.

Simon Sinek, skilled remixer of historical knowledge, explains that sacrifice is a necessary
component of leadership<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP38Cxve5xY">YouTube Video</a></span>,
but that the people running organizations will do anything but sacrifice themselves, but he doesn't
talk about how they go astray despite the obvious consequences of their behaviors. And, despite the
obvious consequences of their behaviors, they will behave in this way because they care more about
themselves than they do about the organization.
