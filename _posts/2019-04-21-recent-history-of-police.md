<h2>Preface</h2>

In 2003, Michelle Goldberg wrote about police suppressing anti-globalization protests
in Miami:
<blockquote>
<p>Armed with millions of dollars of new equipment and inflamed by weeks of warnings about 
anarchists out to destroy their city, police in Miami donned riot gear, assembled by the 
thousand, put the city on lockdown and unleashed an arsenal of crowd control weaponry on 
overwhelmingly peaceful gatherings.</p>

</blockquote>
The hyper-proactivity of the police was following on the 1999 Seattle riots{% include /aside.html nid="millman18" text='<a href="https://www.seattlepi.com/local/seattle-history/article/WTO-Riots-Battle-Seattle-1999-anniversary-13431709.php">Millman, 2018</a>'%}. I declined
an invitation to that event while I was in college. I also lost a debate to Brenna Bell,
cited by Goldberg in Miami, in my most-successful college tournament. I have been on the edge
of this circle multiple times in my life. Natasha Lennard{% include /aside.html nid="lennard11" text='<a 
href="https://www.salon.com/2011/11/23/robocops_vs_the_occupiers/">2011</a>' %}
looked at how this grew into a reflexive repression of political and economic protest, quoting
former Seattle Police Chief Stamper despairing that "The message doesn't seem to go through: 
Militarized tactics exacerbate situations."

<h2>Police facilitate and exacerbate politicized and racist violence</h2> 

A particularly problematic aspect of police being ideologically arrayed against "anarchists"
is that they end up playing well with Nazis in Sacramento{% include /aside.html nid="levin18" text='<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/09/california-police-white-supremacists-counter-protest">Levin, 2018</a>' %} and right-wing
extremists in Portland{% include /aside.html nid="fortin19" text='<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/us/portland-police-patriot-prayer-texts.html">Fortin, 2019</a>'%}. We are well aware that 
"Law enforcement, the military, and politics in the United 
States have been infiltrated by white supremacists, who use it to recruit others and gain 
paramilitary training"{% include /aside.html nid="hall18" text='<a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/in-the-us-white-supremacists-have-infiltrated-police-and-military-to-get-weapons-training-20180209-p4yzs5.html">Hall,
2018</a>'%} and that the FBI raised a warning about it over a decade ago{% include /aside.html nid="downs16" text='<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/fbi-white-supremacists-in-law-enforcement">Downs, 2016</a>; <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/01/31/the-fbi-has-quietly-investigated-white-supremacist-infiltration-of-law-enforcement/">Speri, 2017</a>'%}. This isn't new; the policy of
Qualified Immunity is supposed to prevent KKK members from engaging in racialized
violence under "color of law" and getting away with it{% include /aside.html nid="miller16" text='<a href="http://www.lexwerks.com/article/trumping-qualified-immunity/">Miller, 2016</a>'%}--with the key word being "supposed."

Looking forward to increasing urban density and environmental pressures from global warming,
the Pentagon’s Joint Special Operations University warns that megacities "are the future breeding 
grounds, incubators, and launching pads for adversaries and hybrid threats"{% include /aside.html nid="turse2018" text='<a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/10/13/pentagon-video-warns-of-unavoidable-dystopian-future-for-worlds-biggest-cities/">Turse, 2018</a>'%}.
It is less-than-clear that the deployment of an admixture of security forces with instigators has
been fully comprehended by the personnel considering this future. Indeed, the indicators suggest
that the Posse Comitatus act that generally prevents military personnel from engaging in domestic
law enforcement is being actively corroded by the ongoing militarization of the civilian police
force{% include /aside.html nid="dowell2017" text='<a href="https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/1130666/policing-in-america-how-dod-helped-undermine-posse-comitatus/">Dowell, 2017</a>'%}. 

To recap: modern policing is lax and porous in its procedures{% include /aside.html nid="aaronson2018barrett2019" text='<a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/01/09/dark-side-fbi-dea-illegal-searches-secret-evidence/">Aaronson, 2018</a>; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/senate-memo-blasts-us-marshals-service-for-alleged-misconduct-overspending/2019/01/03/d322ee7c-0f9a-11e9-831f-3aa2c2be4cbd_story.html">Barrett, 2019</a>'%}, is deployed unequally on racial

is elevating the disciplinary records of 85,000 police officers who faced charges of misconduct
across the past decade{% include /aside.html nid="kelly2019" text='<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2019/04/24/usa-today-revealing-misconduct-records-police-cops/3223984002/">Kelly &amp; Nichols, 2019</a>'%}.

<h2>Overdeployment to find the bad guys</h2>

By way of contrast, it should be noted that when New York City was forced to give up its 
racially-charged Stop-and-Frisk program, crime went down {% include /aside.html nid="sexton2018" text='(<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/in-new-york-crime-falls-along-with-police-stops">Sexton, 2018</a>'%}, contrary to Pentagon paranoia
which reflects the FBI's lucrative pivot toward terror plots{% include /aside.html nid="aaronson2013" text='<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Terror-Factory-Inside-Maufactured-Terrorism-ebook/dp/B00ATLNH78/">Aaronson, 2013</a>'%}: the people
engaged in these enforcement activities like to believe that their work is good and valuable. This
is a convienent post-hoc fallacy that saves them from questioning the rightness of their actions
so long as they are doing something, and it is problematic because there is no limit to the systems
of law enforcement that can be grown and deployed so long as some crime is operating on counter-
systemic vectors.

I knew a man a couple of years ago who was employed by the FBI and he was certain that the "bad guys
are out there" and it was his job to catch them. He did not specify that any crime had occurred;
it seemed that in his mind that crimes were bound to occur, and the people committing the crimes
were bad people, so if he could just catch the bad people then crime would decrease. As New York's
lack of an increase in crime indicates, this is not the case. And it's even less of the case
when observing that, for example and in pursuit of cybercrime, "the FBI operated the site for nearly 
two weeks, allowing thousands of images of child pornography to be downloaded (a federal crime, which carries 
steep penalties)"{% include /aside.html nid="rumold2016" text='<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/playpen-story-fbis-unprecedented-and-illegal-hacking-operation">Rumold, 2016</a>'%}. This isn't to say that I think the individual FBI officer I knew was a bad person (regarless of my
personal feelings about him) but rather that he wasn't putting in the hard work of critical self-
reflection necessary to elevate him to being a particularly good person.

The fundamental problem here is that most people aren't bad enough to be particularly bad, so
nurturing the adversarial mindset that "bad guys are out there" in much the same way there are
chronic vague warnings about "anarchists" positions law enforcement at ideological odds with the
communities they are--at least historically--supposed to serve and protect because they (we) are
not that bad.

<h2>Police surveillance and feedback loops</h2>

Part of the problem with Stop-and-Frisk was that it targeted allegedly high-crime neighborhoods. Those
neighborhoods were high-crime because that's where the police were recording paperwork. This resulted
in more police being deployed and generating more paperwork: it's a feedback loop and it exacerbates
all prejudicial problems with predictive policing: "in numerous jurisdictions, [predictive policing] 
systems are built on data produced during documented periods of flawed, racially biased, and sometimes 
unlawful practices and policies"{% include /aside.html nid="richardson2019" text='<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3333423">Richardson, 
Schultz, &amp; Crawford, 2019</a>; <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/2019-04-16/dirty-data-bad-predictions">Presentation</a>'%}.

That's the very short of it. Looking closer, we see that police are collecting data from a variety of
unsanitary sources inclusive of social media{% include /aside.html nid="robinson2018" text='<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/blog/when-facebook-lands-you-jail">Robinson,
2018</a>'%} and decontextualized warrantless surveillance{% include /aside.html nid="vincent2017" text='<a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/40292/broad-warrantless-surveillance-threatens-undermine-criminal-justice-system/">St. Vincent, 2017</a>'%} to
automate the creation of databases thar are full of "usual suspects" but the quality of which is also
usually suspect{% include /aside.html nid="realsearch2012dumke2018" text='<a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/40292/broad-warrantless-surveillance-threatens-undermine-criminal-justice-system/">RealSearch, 2012</a>; <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/politic-il-insider-chicago-gang-database">Dumke,
2018</a>'%}. The databases are spawned at the nexus of "the threshold for inclusion in law enforcement
databases is lower, now including individuals who have not had direct police contact" and "previously 
separate data systems are merged, facilitating the spread of surveillance into a wide range of 
institutions"{% include /aside.html nid="brayne2017" text='<a href="http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/attach/journals/oct17asrfeature.pdf">Brayne, 2017</a>'%}. This repositions the assertions of guilt-by-association from a
troubling violation of First Amendment protections to a standard justification for police enforcement
as New York demonstrated by arresting 120 people as part of a major gang bust, but couldn't prove that
most of them were even gang members let alone violent criminals{% include /aside.html nid="speri2019" text='<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/04/25/bronx-120-report-mass-gang-prosecution-rico/">Speri, 2019</a>'%}.

<h2>Profiteering</h2>

Police are not generally doing the IT work in these situations; that gets outsourced to companies that
promise to increase police effectiveness and efficiency and--ultimately--save taxpayer money (even after 
their enormous fees are paid). One leading vendor of these capabilities is Palantir: their work has been
deployed in Los Angeles{% include /aside.html nid="thompson2018" text='<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/crime-los-angeles-predictive-policing-algorithms-1.4826030">Thompson,
2018</a>'%} and, unsuccessfully, in New Orleans{% include /aside.html nid="winston2018johansson2019" text='<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17054740/palantir-predictive-policing-tool-new-orleans-nopd">Winston, 2018</a>; <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/19/5-lessons-learned-from-the-predictive-policing-failure-in-new-orleans/">Johansson, 2019</a>; <a href="https://github.com/lucyparsons/public_foiadocs">FOIA repository</a>'%}. New York, meanwhile, appears to be sourcing its technology 
from China{% include /aside.html nid="chen2019" text='<a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/2181749/chinese-technology-helping-new-york-police-keep-closer-eye-united">Chen, 2019</a>'%} which
is probably not an improvement. This work is being grown towards the well-funded Pentagon's paranoia about megacities,
specifically on the gang-affiliation vector{% include /aside.html nid="burrington2018" text='<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17285058/predictive-policing-predpol-pentagon-ai-racial-bias">Winston &amp; Burrington, 2018</a>'%} but with little
concern for the typically racialized and routinely classist collateral damage it recommends{% include /aside.html nid="hoffman2018" text='<a href="https://medium.com/s/story/data-violence-and-how-bad-engineering-choices-can-damage-society-39e44150e1d4">Hoffman, 2018</a>'%}.

Police are also not the sole vector for data collection. Between 2013 and 2018, the quantity of school
districts investing in the outsourcing of monitoring their students' social media grew ten-fold with
Social Sentinel being the main recipient of education funds{% include /aside.html nid="pateletc2019" text='<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/school-surveillance-zone">Patel, Levinson-Waldman, Lee, &amp; DenUyl, 2019</a>' %}.
The eventuality that data retained by Social Sentinel will be decontextualized and aggregated into another risk-assessing
database seems to simply be a question of cost/benefit analysis, not of human rights.

Additionally, the particular vector of facial recognition is both being actively developed at the
behest of Homeland Security as a plank of their broad surveillance capability{% include /aside.html nid="lynch2018" text='<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/hart-homeland-securitys-massive-new-database-will-include-face-recognition-dna-and">Lynch, 2018</a>'%},
only there's a major problem: facial recognition is wildly unreliable particularly for underrepresented
minorities. Vendors routinely misrepresent their products' capabilities resulting in deployment problems{% include /aside.html nid="mcneil2018" text='<a href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/big-brothers-blind-spot-mcneil">McNeil, 2018</a>'%}. The ACLU
took particular issue with Amazon's offering, finding that it "falsely matched 28 members of congress
with mugshots"{% include /aside.html nid="snow2018" text='<a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/amazons-face-recognition-falsely-matched-28">Snow, 2018</a>'%}, but this came as no surprise to the FBI
which recieved six key recommendations for its use of facial recognition technology in 2016 and has
implemented none of them{% include /aside.html nid="corrigan2019" text='<a href="https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2019/04/say-freeze-gao-says-fbis-facial-recognition-flawed/156436/">Corrigan, 2019</a>'%}. This did not stop
police in Oregon's Washington county from being enthusiastic early adopters of Amazon's 
system{% include /aside.html nid="harwell2019" text='<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/30/amazons-facial-recognition-technology-is-supercharging-local-police/">Harwell, 2019</a>'%}. An increasing
cadence of backlash is rising against misidentifications, predominantly targeting the vendors rather
than the politically-protected enforcers{% include /aside.html nid="samueletc2019" text='<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/27/18518598/ai-facial-recognition-ban-apple-amazon-microsoft">Samuel, 2019</a>; <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/04/28/brown-student-mistaken-identified-sri-lanka-bombings-suspect/0hP2YwyYi4qrCEdxKZCpZM/story.html">Fox, 2019</a>' %}.
Ironically, while several technology companies are beginning to demur on the deployment of algorithmically-driven
criminal justice, their focus is on the systems that try "to predict how likely a defendant or prisoner is 
to re-offend if released"{% include /aside.html nid="kahn2019" text='<a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/report-on-machine-learning-in-risk-assessment-tools-in-the-u-s-criminal-justice-system/">Partnership on AI, 2019</a>; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-26/major-tech-firms-come-out-against-police-use-of-ai-algorithms">Kahn, 2019</a>' %} and not the systems that
they're already actively selling to law enforcement agencies.

Stepping back from facial recognition to the relatively tame license plate recognition doesn't solve
for all of the harms because they are still subject to the "pitfalls of automated policing, where one 
piece of bad information can lead to a guns-drawn confrontation"{% include /aside.html nid="warzel2019" text='<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/opinion/when-license-plate-surveillance-goes-horribly-wrong.html">Warzel, 2019</a>'%}. The fundamental problem
of automation is that it efficiently compresses our humanity rather than merely compressing the work
we do leaving an increased space for our humanity and this pattern is replicated in state-on-individual
violence: as General Hayden asserted, "We kill people based on metadata"{% include /aside.html nid="cole2014" text='<a href="https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2014/05/10/we-kill-people-based-metadata/">Cole, 2014</a>'%}.

<h2>Surveillance: Example and abstraction</h2>
Let's take a short break from the police to cover the theory background of surveillance and power,
and we'll borrow the headline "Disney has fired Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn over old, 
gross tweets" with the note that "There was a conservative push to make it happen"{% include /aside.html nid="abadsantos2018" text='<a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/7/20/17596506/disney-fired-james-gunn-guardians">Abad-Santos, 2018</a>'%} as the smallest possible implementation of
the pattern.

First, Foucault observes that Twitter is easy to use and this has implications.

<blockquote>
<p>For a long time ordinary individuality – the everyday individuality of everybody – remained below 
the threshold of description. To be looked at, observed, described in detail, followed from day to day 
by an uninterrupted writing was a privilege. The chronicle of a man, the account of his life, his 
historiography, written as he lived out his life formed part of the rituals of his power. The 
disciplinary methods reversed this relation, lowered the threshold of describable individuality and 
made of this description a means of control and a method of domination. It is no longer a monument for 
future memory, but a document for possible use. ... This turning of real lives into writing is no 
longer a procedure of heroization; it functions as a procedure of objectification and subjection.</p>
<footer>Foucault, 1975, p. 191-192</footer>
</blockquote>

There are two major things going on here:
<ol>
<li>Some people like contributing to their surveillance because it makes them feel important. Not necessarily
state-sponsored surveillance directly (they never retweet us!), but certainly posting on Twitter, on Facebook, 
on Instagram, and measuring the social capital they hold: this is a modern ritual of power.</li>
<li>More importantly, however, is that the surveillance mechanism does not forget: the long-running document
for possible use becomes a customized snare, a collection of minor infractions pressed together and magnified
to appear as an avalanche of malfeasance with slow justice eventually blindsiding the unlucky individual. 
This can be seen in the dossier that Agent Smith reveals to Thomas Anderson in <em>The Matrix</em> or in the
subtext that "there was a conservative push" to get James Gunn blacklisted because of old tweets he had
forgotten about.</li>
</ol>

Next, Gunn's lack of self-discipline regarding his public tweets made him vulnerable. Surveillance, even
discontinuous, random, adversarial surveillance requires ample discipline in action. More precisely,
because the status and usage of the surveillance power is unkown and no actual relationship can be
engaged, individuals are necessarily responsible to act in conformance with the expectations of the 
unknown audience.
<blockquote>
<p>Hence the major effect of the Panopticon: to induce in the inmate a state of conscious and permanent 
visibility that assures the automatic functioning of power. So to arrange things that the surveillance is 
permanent in its effects, even if it is discontinuous in its action; that the perfection of power should 
tend to render its actual exercise unnecessary; that this architectural apparatus should be a machine for 
creating and sustaining a power relation independent of the person who exercises it; in short, that the 
inmates should be caught up in a power situation of which they are themselves the bearers.</p>
<footer>Foucault, 1975, p. 201</footer>
</blockquote>
The threshold for actually triggering responses is highly variable, limiting the precision with which
self-discipline is an accessible effect (and is never quite enforced), but the idea is there.

All of this goes into the larger question of social values and what kind of a world people want to live
in. Foucault reminds us that we're not all looking to the same future:

<blockquote>
<p>{{ site.data.cards.foucault.discipline.cards[0].text }}</p>
<footer>{{ site.data.cards.foucault.discipline.cards[0].cite }}</footer>
</blockquote>

The goal of the Panoptic surveillance society is not so much about preventing crime, but about keeping
the masses of socioeconomically insignificant people in their place while the powerful and connected
do whatever they want. As Chesterton (1908) explained, "The poor have sometimes objected to being governed 
badly; the rich have always objected to being governed at all" (p. 107).

Gunn was powerful and connected enough to be rehired{% include /aside.html nid="guardian2019" text='<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/15/james-gunn-guardians-of-the-galaxy-3">Guardian Film, 2019</a>'%}. When this pattern played out on Quinn
Norton, her consolation prize was an article in <em>The Atlantic</em>{% include /aside.html nid="norton2018" text='<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/02/the-new-york-times-fired-my-doppelganger/554402/">2018</a>'%}. 
Contrariwise, Trump engages in behavior
ranging from the unsavory to the criminal in full display but continues to have tens of millions of
supporters.

To summarize: surveillance gives knowledge of subjects which has the potential to be turned into power
and wielded asynchronously against them. Most people, being aware of the possibility of that power and
underrating their capacity to resist it, will attempt to conform their behavior to avoid causing a
confrontation. But the cost/benefit analysis of such a confrontation is highly variable resulting in
uneven reactions of power across a population.


<h2>For-profit policing</h2>
In many ways, the worst part of this is that these technologies are going to be intentionally oppressive
to ensure that funding can be extracted from an increasingly criminalized public. Between aggressive and
compounding municipal fines{% include /aside.html nid="sanchezk2018" text='<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2018/02/how-does-chicago-make-200-million-a-year-on-parking-tickets-by-bankrupting-thousands-of-drivers/">Sanchez

The impacts of for-profit policing are predominantly inflicted on the poor who have scant means of legal
recourse{% include /aside.html nid="edelman2017tabbi2014" text='<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Not-Crime-Be-Poor-Criminalization-ebook/dp/B01MYEIZ5V/">Edelman, 2017</a>;

Of course, there's limited direct value in the process: "a homeless man in Sacramento, California, living under a 
bridge received 190 citations from police (almost all related to sleeping outside and camping) and wound up 
being assessed $104,000 in unpayable fines"{% include /aside.html nid="phillipsfein2018" text='<a href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/privatizing-poverty-phillips-fein">Phillips-Fein, 2018</a>'%}. But in states that prevent the incarcerated and ex-convicts from voting, this is a functional means of
disenfranchising citizens of the right to vote. Beyond suppression of the vote, incarcerated people are also
useful to gerrymanderers because they are considered to be residents of their prison, commonly inflating the
