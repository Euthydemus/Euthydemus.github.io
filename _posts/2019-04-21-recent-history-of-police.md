<h2>Preface</h2>

In 2003, Michelle Goldberg wrote about police suppressing anti-globalization protests
in Miami:
<blockquote>
<p>Armed with millions of dollars of new equipment and inflamed by weeks of warnings about 
anarchists out to destroy their city, police in Miami donned riot gear, assembled by the 
thousand, put the city on lockdown and unleashed an arsenal of crowd control weaponry on 
overwhelmingly peaceful gatherings.</p>
<footer><a href="https://www.salon.com/2003/12/17/miami_police/">Goldberg, 2003</a></footer>
</blockquote>
The hyper-proactivity of the police was following on the <a href="https://www.seattlepi.com/local/seattle-history/article/WTO-Riots-Battle-Seattle-1999-anniversary-13431709.php">1999 Seattle riots</a>. I declined
an invitation to that event while I was in college. I also lost a debate to Brenna Bell,
cited by Goldberg in Miami, in my most-successful college tournament. I have been on the edge
of this circle multiple times in my life. Natasha Lennard (<a 
href="https://www.salon.com/2011/11/23/robocops_vs_the_occupiers/">2011</a>)
looked at how this grew into a reflexive repression of political and economic protest, quoting
former Seattle Police Chief Stamper despairing that "The message doesn't seem to go through: 
Militarized tactics exacerbate situations."

<h2>Police facilitate and exacerbate politicized and racist violence</h2> 

A particularly problematic aspect of police being ideologically arrayed against "anarchists"
is that they end up playing well with Nazis in Sacramento (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/09/california-police-white-supremacists-counter-protest">Levin, 2018</a>) and right-wing
extremists in Portland (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/us/portland-police-patriot-prayer-texts.html">Fortin,
2019</a>). We are well aware that "Law enforcement, the military, and politics in the United 
States have been infiltrated by white supremacists, who use it to recruit others and gain 
paramilitary training" (<a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/in-the-us-white-supremacists-have-infiltrated-police-and-military-to-get-weapons-training-20180209-p4yzs5.html">Hall,
2018</a>) and that the FBI raised a warning about it over a decade ago (<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/fbi-white-supremacists-in-law-enforcement">Downs, 2016</a>). This isn't new; the policy of
Qualified Immunity is supposed to prevent KKK members from engaging in racialized
violence under "color of law" and getting away with it (<a href="http://www.lexwerks.com/article/trumping-qualified-immunity/">Miller, 
2016</a>)--with the key word being "supposed."

Looking forward to increasing urban density and environmental pressures from global warming,
the Pentagonâ€™s Joint Special Operations University warns that megacities "are the future breeding 
grounds, incubators, and launching pads for adversaries and hybrid threats" (<a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/10/13/pentagon-video-warns-of-unavoidable-dystopian-future-for-worlds-biggest-cities/">Turse, 2018</a>).
It is less-than-clear that the deployment of an admixture of security forces with instigators has
been fully comprehended by the personnel considering this future. Indeed, the indicators suggest
that the Posse Comitatus act that generally prevents military personnel from engaging in domestic
law enforcement is being actively corroded by the ongoing militarization of the civilian police
force (<a href="https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/1130666/policing-in-america-how-dod-helped-undermine-posse-comitatus/">Dowell, 2017</a>). 

To recap: modern policing is lax and porous in its procedures (<a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/01/09/dark-side-fbi-dea-illegal-searches-secret-evidence/"> , 2018</a>; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/senate-memo-blasts-us-marshals-service-for-alleged-misconduct-overspending/2019/01/03/d322ee7c-0f9a-11e9-831f-3aa2c2be4cbd_story.html">Barrett, 2019</a>), is deployed unequally on racial
animus (<a href="https://5harad.com/papers/100M-stops.pdf">Pierson et al, 2019</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/5harad/status/1105985260041297920">discussion</a> and <a href="https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/">data</a>), resulting
in elevated violence against the populace (<a href="https://granta.com/violence-in-blue/">Ball, 2016</a>)
with associated liability settlements (<a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-stringer-report-nypd-payout-settlement-lawsuits-20190415-2zzm2zkhpna63dtlcr2zks6eoq-story.html">Rayman
&amp; Guse, 2019</a>; <a href="http://dpbh.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/A%20MillionDollarMurray.pdf">Gladwell, 2006</a>)
and also their intimate partners and families (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/09/police-officers-who-hit-their-wives-or-girlfriends/380329/">Friedersdorf, 2014</a>). USA Today
is elevating the disciplinary records of 85,000 police officers who faced charges of misconduct
across the past decade (<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2019/04/24/usa-today-revealing-misconduct-records-police-cops/3223984002/">Kelly &amp; Nichols, 2019</a>)

<h2>Overdeployment to find the bad guys</h2>

By way of contrast, it should be noted that when New York City was forced to give up its 
racially-charged Stop-and-Frisk program, crime went down (<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/in-new-york-crime-falls-along-with-police-stops">Sexton, 2018</a>), contrary to Pentagon paranoia
which reflects the FBI's lucrative pivot toward terror plots (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Terror-Factory-Inside-Maufactured-Terrorism-ebook/dp/B00ATLNH78/">Aaronson, 2013</a>): the people
engaged in these enforcement activities like to believe that their work is good and valuable. This
is a convienent post-hoc fallacy that saves them from questioning the rightness of their actions
so long as they are doing something, and it is problematic because there is no limit to the systems
of law enforcement that can be grown and deployed so long as some crime is operating on counter-
systemic vectors.

I knew a man a couple of years ago who was employed by the FBI and he was certain that the "bad guys
are out there" and it was his job to catch them. He did not specify that any crime had occurred;
it seemed that in his mind that crimes were bound to occur, and the people committing the crimes
were bad people, so if he could just catch the bad people then crime would decrease. As New York's
lack of an increase in crime indicates, this is not the case. And it's even less of the case
when observing that, for example and in pursuit of cybercrime, "the FBI operated the site for nearly 
two weeks, allowing thousands of images of child pornography to be downloaded (a federal crime, which carries 
steep penalties)" (<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/playpen-story-fbis-unprecedented-and-illegal-hacking-operation">Rumold, 2016</a>). This isn't to say that I think the individual FBI officer I knew was a bad person (regarless of my
personal feelings about him) but rather that he wasn't putting in the hard work of critical self-
reflection necessary to elevate him to being a particularly good person.

The fundamental problem here is that most people aren't bad enough to be particularly bad, so
nurturing the adversarial mindset that "bad guys are out there" in much the same way there are
chronic vague warnings about "anarchists" positions law enforcement at ideological odds with the
communities they are--at least historically--supposed to serve and protect because they (we) are
not that bad.

<h2>Police surveillance and feedback loops</h2>

Part of the problem with Stop-and-Frisk was that it targeted allegedly high-crime neighborhoods. Those
neighborhoods were high-crime because that's where the police were recording paperwork. This resulted
in more police being deployed and generating more paperwork: it's a feedback loop and it exacerbates
all prejudicial problems with predictive policing: "in numerous jurisdictions, [predictive policing] 
systems are built on data produced during documented periods of flawed, racially biased, and sometimes 
unlawful practices and policies" (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3333423">Richardson, 
Schultz, &amp; Crawford, 2019</a>; <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/2019-04-16/dirty-data-bad-predictions">Presentation</a>).

That's the very short of it. Looking closer, we see that police are collecting data from a variety of
unsanitary sources inclusive of social media (<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/blog/when-facebook-lands-you-jail">Robinson,
2018</a>) and decontextualized warrantless surveillance (<a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/40292/broad-warrantless-surveillance-threatens-undermine-criminal-justice-system/">St. Vincent, 2017</a>) to
automate the creation of databases thar are full of "usual suspects" but the quality of which is also
usually suspect (<a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/40292/broad-warrantless-surveillance-threatens-undermine-criminal-justice-system/">RealSearch, 2012</a>; <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/politic-il-insider-chicago-gang-database">Dumke,
2018</a>). The databases are spawned at the nexus of "the threshold for inclusion in law enforcement
databases is lower, now including individuals who have not had direct police contact" and "previously 
separate data systems are merged, facilitating the spread of surveillance into a wide range of 
institutions" (<a href="http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/attach/journals/oct17asrfeature.pdf">Brayne,
2017</a>).

<h2>Profiteering</h2>

Police are not generally doing the IT work in these situations; that gets outsourced to companies that
promise to increase police effectiveness and efficiency and--ultimately--save taxpayer money (even after 
their enormous fees are paid). One leading vendor of these capabilities is Palantir: their work has been
deployed in Los Angeles (<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/crime-los-angeles-predictive-policing-algorithms-1.4826030">Thompson,
2018</a>) and, unsuccessfully, in New Orleans (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17054740/palantir-predictive-policing-tool-new-orleans-nopd">Winston, 2018</a>; <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/19/5-lessons-learned-from-the-predictive-policing-failure-in-new-orleans/">Johansson, 2019</a>; <a href="https://github.com/lucyparsons/public_foiadocs">FOIA repository</a>). New York, meanwhile, appears to be sourcing its technology 
from China (<a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/2181749/chinese-technology-helping-new-york-police-keep-closer-eye-united">Chen, 2019</a>) which
is probably not an improvement. This work is being grown towards the well-funded Pentagon's paranoia about megacities,
specifically on the gang-affiliation vector (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17285058/predictive-policing-predpol-pentagon-ai-racial-bias">Winston &amp; Burrington, 2018</a>) but with little
concern for the typically racialized and routinely classist collateral damage it recommends (<a href="https://medium.com/s/story/data-violence-and-how-bad-engineering-choices-can-damage-society-39e44150e1d4">Hoffman, 2018</a>).

Additionally, the particular vector of facial recognition is both being actively developed at the
behest of Homeland Security as a plank of their broad surveillance capability (<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/hart-homeland-securitys-massive-new-database-will-include-face-recognition-dna-and">Lynch, 2018</a>),
only there's a major problem: facial recognition is wildly unreliable particularly for underrepresented
minorities. Vendors routinely misrepresent their products' capabilities resulting in deployment problems
(<a href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/big-brothers-blind-spot-mcneil">McNeil, 2018</a>). The ACLU
took particular issue with Amazon's offering, finding that it "falsely matched 28 members of congress
with mugshots" (<a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/amazons-face-recognition-falsely-matched-28">Snow, 2018</a>), but this came as no surprise to the FBI
which recieved six key recommendations for its use of facial recognition technology in 2016 and has
implemented none of them (<a href="https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2019/04/say-freeze-gao-says-fbis-facial-recognition-flawed/156436/">Corrigan, 2019</a>).

<h2>For-profit policing</h2>

In many ways, the worst part of this is that these technologies are going to be intentionally oppressive
to ensure that funding can be extracted from an increasingly criminalized public. Between aggressive and
compounding municipal fines (<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2018/02/how-does-chicago-make-200-million-a-year-on-parking-tickets-by-bankrupting-thousands-of-drivers/">Sanchez
&amp; Kambhampati, 2018</a>) and civil asset forfeitures (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/23/cops-took-more-stuff-from-people-than-burglars-did-last-year/?utm_term=.ce53e1b04b94">Ingraham, 2015</a>;
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2014/09/06/stop-and-seize/?post_id=837072795_10153178956682796#_=_">Sallah et al, 2014</a>; <a href="https://www.greenvilleonline.com/in-depth/news/taken/2019/01/27/civil-forfeiture-south-carolina-police-property-seizures-taken-exclusive-investigation/2457838002/#southcarolinaslegallegacy">Lee, Cary, &amp; Ellis, 2019</a>), modern policing is doing more economic damage to the citizenry than crime is. The 
Southern Poverty Law Center notes that "some 10 million people owe $50 billion in court debt" and
that the recent Supreme Court ruling to limit civil asset forfeiture will be cutting into $4.5 billion
in annual police funding (<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2019/04/16/what-supreme-court-ruling-could-mean-civil-asset-forfeiture">Early, 2019</a>), funding that police department
are likely to attempt to recover through alternate--extractive--means; the IRS previously ramped up asset
forfeiture claims while having its operational funding--and ability to collect taxes from the wealthy--curtailed
 (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/05/the-irs-took-millions-from-innocent-people-because-of-how-they-managed-their-bank-accounts-inspector-general-finds/?utm_term=.56f766c5d4a1">Ingraham, 2017</a>; <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-irs-was-gutted">Kiel 
 &amp; Eisinger, 2018</a>).

The impacts of for-profit policing are predominantly inflicted on the poor who have scant means of legal
recourse (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Not-Crime-Be-Poor-Criminalization-ebook/dp/B01MYEIZ5V/">Edelman, 2017</a>;
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Divide-American-Injustice-Age-Wealth-ebook/dp/B00EBRUB02/">Taibbi, 2014</a>).
Of course, there's limited direct value in the process: "a homeless man in Sacramento, California, living under a 
bridge received 190 citations from police (almost all related to sleeping outside and camping) and wound up 
being assessed $104,000 in unpayable fines" (<a href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/privatizing-poverty-phillips-fein">Phillips-Fein, 2018</a>). But in states that prevent the incarcerated and ex-convicts from voting, this is a functional means of
disenfranchising citizens of the right to vote. After Florida restored voting rights to ex-convicts, the
legislature passed a bill to require all court fees to be paid prior to exercising voting rights (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/25/politics/florida-amendment-4-voting-rights-felons/index.html">Stracqualursi, 2019</a>; <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/25/18277470/amendment-4-florida-felon-voting-rights-fees-legislation">Lockhart, 2019</a>). Some state and federal
social programs also exlude ex-convicts as a means of reserving resources for the so-called "deserving" poor,
but this leads directly to increased recidivism (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=2845435">Tuttle, 2018</a>).
