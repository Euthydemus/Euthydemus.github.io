<h2>Habitual preparation.</h2>
Extemporaneous speaking's evolution to incorporate digital assistance in topic research was
inevitable, but has the unfortunate side-effect of making competitors believe that they only
need to do a half-hour of research to know speech-worthy information about a topic. This
results in a lot of swagger and saying things like the Brazilian government needs to learn
High School-level economics and not nearly enough analysis or understanding.

So let's fix that. The best extemporaneous speakers--of whom I have coached several--all
know that they need to cultivate pools of knowledge over long periods of time, prefer topics
that fall into their specialty areas, and then spend their preparation time polishing and
refining all of the information they'd already consumed into a cogent answer to the question
posed to them. Here's the set of specific practices to get started on this path.

<h2>The discipline.</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Read a couple of (that's 2) short news articles per day, 6 days per week.</strong> 
Cover at least 3 topics (or countries) per week, have at least 3 sources: like Venezuela, Brexit, 
and China Trade would be super obvious topics at the moment, and keep up with those on like the 
Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, and Economist to cover them across a week from a spectrum 
of (boring) mainstream sources. <strong>This should only take 10-15 minutes a day</strong>, and 
you'll get faster with practice. When you want to do better, read more and collect local sources 
from around the world; there's no limit other than how much time you want to spend. It's also okay 
to defer starting this until 6 weeks before the tournament date (as short-form knowledge does get 
stale).</li>
<li><strong>Read one long-form, deep journalism article per week</strong>--like Sunday evening or 
something. It can be on any topic and it is fine and recommended for this article to cross-apply 
to something you need to know for a class. Scribble down a short paragraph of notes to cover the 
most amazing things it covers--it's good for your memory. While magazines like <em>The New Yorker</em> 
or <em>The Atlantic</em> work well for this, more aggressively-specialized sources (for example: 
<a href="https://warontherocks.com/">War on the Rocks</a> is national defense talk) can be better. 
<em>Special note:</em> if the article is boring you, then it's a good idea to drop it and find a 
different article because it's not going to be interesting when you describe it to somebody else, 
either.</li>
<li><strong>Watch TV.</strong> You are so lucky on this point: my generation didn't have the option to watch John Oliver or Hassan Minaj or Sam Bee, but all of them expect their audience to be rather smart and their entertainment value works with that. You can learn something not just about current issues, but also about presentation style. (Minaj is the best at this for Extemp because he has the cleanest division between his jokes and his content.) Remember that you can speed up online video, either natively on most streams or using a "Video Speed Controller" browser plug-in.</li>
<li><strong>Podcasts are another thing you've totally got going for you.</strong> I so very recommend the War on the Rocks: Bombshell podcast (<a href="https://warontherocks.com/2019/03/bombshell-think-instead-about-having-a-great-life/">sample episode</a>) featuring a panel of national security analyst ladies. They very much see past the bullshit and give you hints on what you should be looking into for the short-article research. These aren't really usable in-round, but the point is to seed your background knowledge: they make connections for you and provide context and it's all super-great. Find and consume as many as you're comfortable with. Again, you can play these back at a comfortably fast pace.</li>
<li>Finally, <strong>spend some time learning material you can twist into introductions.</strong> Aesop's Fables are simple and flexible and if you don't have a lot of them at you beck-and-call then spend time familiarizing yourself with them. Having a synopsis-level grasp of Shakespeare's more popular plays is also a good idea, et cetera. And this is also good material to have in your mind when doing impromptu or churning out essays for English class. For example, the Dr. Seuss classic <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> can demonstrate how we have to persist in getting people to accept new food sources as a critical part of mitigating climate change, or it could be a key component of how we undermine respect for other people's opinions and consent by telling a story of badgering somebody to do something they'll enjoy until they give in. More concretely, here's <a href="http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/the-interpreter/keeping-it-real-australias-outlook-indonesia">Natalie Sambhi lacing international security with rap references</a> and this is the style you should strive to achieve.</li>
<li>Once you've got your material, <strong>write a practice speech once or twice a week.</strong> Give yourself a softball question you know you can deal with because you've got the material right there and write out the answer. Your main goal here is to get to the point where you know what 7 minutes of material feels like for when you're doing prep. Bonus points if you turn these into essays and blog posts to boost your exposure for the future (refer again to Natalie's work, referenced above), but it's also okay to start this 4 weeks before the tournament.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tapping into social media.</h2>
One last recommendation that relates to "boost your exposure" is to go lurk on Twitter and follow the very clever analysts (and/or their think-tanky institutions, but not noisy newspapers or magazines) who share the materials you may need to also talk about. They will likely feed you the information you need to fill your quotas on items 1 & 2. This is how I know things, and grad school taught me that it's a legitimate way to cultivate knowledge so yay for that. Here's some of my list for International Extemp:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/tanvi_madan">@tanvi_madan</a> -- Tanvi Madan is with the Brookings Institute and is
particularly specialized on India.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/charlie_simpson">@charlie_simpson</a> -- Erin Simpson specializes in United States
foreign policy, especially military. She's one of the hosts of Bombshell (recommended above) and is known to have
done debate in high school.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/draganakaurin">@draganakaurin</a> -- Dragana Kaurin is affiliated with the Harvard's Berkman
Klein Center, and specilizes on human rights and refugee issues. She was a refugee from Sarajevo.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/ndreasp">@ndreasp</a> -- Andreas Paleit covers global issues, predominantly economic,
and does a good job of highlighting his sources.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/SionaJ">@SionaJ</a> -- Siona Jenkis is also a journalist focused mostly on Eurozone issues.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/MiraRappHooper">@MiraRappHooper</a> -- Mira Rapp-Hooper, a lecturer at Yale Law School. You can see her amazing delivery when talking
about <a href="https://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/negotiations-can-denuclearize-north-korea">the infeasibility 
of negotiating North Korean de-nuclearlization</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/SecurityScholar">@SecurityScholar</a> -- you should aspire to be as amazing as Natalie Sambhi.
Several of my former students have confirmed, unsolicited, that she is a badass.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/TXNatSecReview">@TXNatSecReview</a> -- Texas National Security Review is a journal that will
give you deeper analysis to get below the surface noise and sound-bites.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/nukes_of_hazard">@nukes_of_hazard</a> -- The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation
is all about international security, particularly nuclear security. They also support high school speech and debate.</li>
</ul> ‚Äè
This is also going to be useful when you want to start following professors and near-peer role models so you can cleverly but gently fangirl at them until they start paying attention to you and perhaps make special or rare opportunities available to you--with the most obvious being DMing them for more information on a specific topic which they will give you because you have been nice to them and they like it when nice people pay attention to them.
