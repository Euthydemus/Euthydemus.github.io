<h2>The Plot</h2>
This movie is a cautionary tale of how an unsecured IoT device compromises
OpSec and almost brings about the end of the universe. That's the actual
useful take-away from this film for most folks. Everything else is 
untrammeled nonsense, with varying levels of watchability.

<h2>Major Problems</h2>
There are a few major problems that are unique to this film, beyond how its
villain cribbed his nefarious plot from the journal of an angry tweenage
boy (as was known in the prior film) who, despite being obsessed with his
rock collection, let two of the rocks go back in 2012.
<ol>
<li><strong>The rat.</strong> The only path to defeat the giant purple
people-eater relies on Scott, who is saved from being lost in the quantum
realm by a rat stepping on the somehow-active control panel for his
mothballed equipment five years after the cataclysm. Somehow this was
a known option in the prophecy that had to have accurately, but impossibly,
predicted what all was going to survive the cataclysm, down to the level
of vermin.</li>
<li><strong>The returners.</strong> So the victory condition for the heroes
is undoing the cataclysm that wiped out half of life some five years prior.
This means--and we see on-screen--that much of civilization has gone
derelict as the population figures out where it's at and what it's doing.
This necessarily means that there's going to be some infrastructure collapse,
that the supply chains for food, water, and power will have been shrunk
and adjusted to the new normal. So when the 3.5 billion humans that got
dusted by the cataclysm show up out of thin air some five years later, the
result will be a bunch of very emotional reunions as a refugee crisis beyond
imagining--really, the writers didn't imagine it at all--clutches the world
population.</li>
<li><strong>The last melee.</strong> The big climax is an almost incoherent brawl
that gets all of the heroes on camera but makes no sense at all: why are the
villains brawling with bombardment is an option? I mean, sure, the heroes
have never had control of the armaments they needed to bring to a battlefield
like this, but for the villains to start the annihilation of a planet by
sending out light infantry is just nuts.</li>
<li><strong>Time travel.</strong> This is never done well, and here they
do it intentionally badly. Some of it is perhaps meant to be read mentally
and emotionally, but the overall deployment is "this lets us do what we want!"
in the manner of a child trying to make sense of playing with all of their
toys.</li>
<li><strong>The time-traveling armada.</strong> There is some major hand
waving done to pull an entire interstellar invading fleet nine years through
time and drop them off in the upper atmosphere of a planet. It's almost as
if they didn't need a rock collection to pull off that manner of bullshit
at all.</li>
<li><strong>Peter Parker's weakness.</strong> Peter Parker is immediately
reduced to a quivering puddle of teenage boy when Carol Danvers is standing
over him. On the one hand, this is perhaps the most realistic thing in the 
film. But then he gives Carol, whom he has never seen before in his life, the 
artifact on the basis of: he trusts and is eager to please hot chicks.
So: props for realism. But it'll make for a very short movie when a more-competent
and equal-opportunity villain recognizes and exploits this obvious weakness.</li>
<li><strong>The soulstone.</strong> Steve returns the soulstone... How?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Steve's Character Failure</h2>
Steve is wildly out of character as soon as the time-travel starts, and this
reaches its apex when he doesn't return from his final mission as expected
but instead lives out the rest of his life in normal time again. The problem
here is that in order for this to happen, Steve has to ignore all of the
knowledge he gained over the past decade--most especially in Winter Soldier--
and let all of the damage happen all over again. For a guy whose two character
traits are that he's got the safest, most reliable and responsible hands of
guardianship and he can do This all day, that's an utterly shocking change of
direction. We knew he was having problems growing and developing, and see his
deontology-oriented core getting shaken by the deceptions he commits during
the heist, but this is a complete collapse of character.

The worst part is that it's entirely unncessary.

I contend that the movie would have been better if Natasha had gone on the
heist and Steve had gone for the soulstone. Natasha's subterfuge in the
elevator would have certainly flowed more naturally than what Steve did.

But the scene that would have been so much stronger is the rematch between
Steve and Johann that presuably happened when Steve retrieved the soulstone,
only now we actually get to see it when he's going to get the soulstone. And
this is because Johann, feeling quasi-omniscient and rather-undying can taunt
Steve mercilessly, starting with the line "You could not live with your own 
failure, and where did that bring you? Back to me..." that would legitimately
make more sense in a conversation between Steve and Johann than where it was
used.

Steve's partner will want to sacrifice themselves, but Johann will explain
that self-sacrifice is the final duty that has to be performed. That duty is
a powerful driver, yes, but has diminishing returns: that failure after
failure accumulates for the people who are driven by their duty until they
just can't take any more failures. Until the weight of time itself drags them
down. And it all starts with the first failure that drives the hero to try
again, to try harder, and to be continuously imperfect, a continuous failure,
and Johann will enumerate the people Steve couldn't save.

Johann will gloat that all the duty that has driven Steve's life, that has
prevented him from really living, started with his inability to truly defeat
Johann. And now, here, there is just one thing left for Steve to do.

And this will make a despairing Steve look up at Johann and consider his
words. "You're right," Steve would tell Johann, and--channeling Ripley
from <em>Alien 3</em>--say "You've been in my life so long, I can't remember 
anything else." Steve stands, begins moving to the edge as his partner
stares in shock and horror. "I guess there really is just one thing left to 
do," Steve says, regaining his composure. "Thank you for making it clear
to me how vital you've been for so much my life."

And suddenly he flings his shield out, knocking Johann clean off the
precipice and into the chasm below.

Steve loved his sense of duty, and in sacrificing Johann he sacrificed that
which was at the core of his being: his never-satisfied sense of duty.
Having fulfilled his first duty of defeating Johann, he feels freed to stand 
down and live his own life, trusting others to fight their own battles.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
While generally better than the other movies in this ensemble series, and
having an enjoyable hour of script at the beginning along with some nice
bits of fan service--Hope, Wanda, and Val were all basically useless but it
was nice to at least see them anyway--and a good close for Tony, it's still 
a mess of a story.

For Marvel films with the fewest critical flaws, I'm still preferring:
<ol>
<li>Ant-man and Wasp</li>
<li>Thor: Ragnarok</li>
<li>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</li>
</ol>
