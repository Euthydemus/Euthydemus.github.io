<h2>Preamble</h2>

The Ethics &amp; Relgious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention released an
"Evangelical Statement of Principles"<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"><a href="https://erlc.com/resource-library/statements/artificial-intelligence-an-evangelical-statement-of-principles" nofollow>ERLC, 2019</a></span> that they claim is about Artificial Intelligence (AI).
The principles they espouse are unsurprising but the link to AI is unclear. Fortunately 
they also released and explanatory document which raises a specific ethical quandary for AI:

<blockquote>
<p>For example, self-driving cars--a type of AMA--need to be programmed for how they should 
respond to scenarios where collisions are highly likely or unavoidable. Should self-driving 
vehicles be programmed to always minimize the number of deaths? Should they be programmed to 
prioritize the lives of their passengers?</p>

Astute readers will recognize this is derived from Foot's fatalistic "Trolley Problem"<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem" nofollow>Wikipedia Entry</a></span>
which is a popular (and wrong) way to think about how autonomous vehicles work,
but it's the dish the Southern Baptists have brought to our ethical potluck. So with this in
mind, I would like to propose...

<h2>The Christian Trolley Problem</h2>
Some time later, God tested you.<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Genesis 22:1; Psalm 66:10</span> God presented you with a runaway trolley 
moving toward the twelve disciples who are distracted by a dispute among them, as to which of them 
should be considered the greatest.<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Luke 22:24-30</span> You are standing next to a lever that controls a switch.
If you pull the lever, the trolley will be redirected onto a side track, and the disciples will be
saved. However, Jesus is on the side track, head bowed in prayer saying "Father, forgive them, for they 
do not know what they are doing."<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Luke 23:34</span> You have two options:
<ol>
<li>Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the twelve disciples on the main track. If you do nothing,
you may be able to get Jesus to forgive you for this,<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Acts 9</span> and Jesus can raise any of the disciples he wants
from the dead,<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">John 11:38-44</span> and any that stay dead are really kind of martyrs anyway, right?</li>
<li>Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill Jesus. This might
actually be okay: Jesus is supposed to be sacrificed for the sins of the world<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">1 John 2:2</span> and really did say "Greater love hath no man than this, that 
a man lay down his life for his friends"<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">John 15:3</span> and this seems like the sort of thing he was talking about.
Besides, you expect that Jesus will rise again in three days anyway.<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Luke 24</span> Only problem is that Jesus is interceding on the explicit point of
"they know not what they do" and you know <em>exactly</em> what you're doing thus putting yourself at risk of
committing an irredeemable sin and facing eternal damnation.</li>
</ol>

God is watching; what do you do?

The Southern Baptists may well look to the story of Abraham<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Genesis 22</span> and take heart against this
quandary. "We do not fear what is to come because we know that God is omniscient and that 
nothing we create will be able to thwart His redemptive plan for creation," they say.<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"><a href="https://erlc.com/resource-library/statements/artificial-intelligence-an-evangelical-statement-of-principles" nofollow>ERLC, 2019</a></span> This confidence should perhaps be tempered with a bit of
fear and trembling, however.

<h2>Fear and Trembling</h2>
Sören Kierkegaard wrote a book focused on Abraham's encounter with an ethical quandary
that results in a good story of faith but a horrifying story of behavior. Kierkegaard
suggests that a pastor preaching a sermon about Abraham may result in a member of the
congregation attempting to sacrifice their own child leading to an exchange of:
"O abominable man, offscouring of society, what devil possessed thee to want to murder 
thy son?" ... "That in fact is what you yourself preached on Sunday."<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.religion-online.org/book-chapter/chapter-2-preliminary-expectoration/">Kierkegaard, 1843, ch. 2</a></span>

What Kierkegaard realizes about religion--he focuses on Christianity from within but draws on
several examples--is that there are routine teleological suspensions of the ethical,
of which Abraham is but a prime example:

<blockquote>
<p>The ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, and the same thing 
is expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. 
[... But] As the individual [Abraham, in moving to sacrifice Isaac,] became higher 
than the universal. This is the paradox which does not permit of mediation. It is just 
as inexplicable how he got into it as it is inexplicable how he remained in it.</p>

This is supposed to comfort you if God is testing you with the Trolley Problem, 
but is of precious little help when you're designing autopilot software for Tesla
and points to the larger deficiency with the Southern Baptists' statement of
principles: <strong>technologists can't codify ethics based on religious precepts 
that are known to suspend ethics for the teleological.</strong>

To put it another way, Tesla's autopilot software does not have the option doing this:

<h2>Moral Non-Agency</h2>
Understanding that the Southern Baptists believe in the domninion of humanity over
God's creation but under God also helps explain why they assert a lack of moral
agency for AI.<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"><a href="https://erlc.com/resource-library/statements/artificial-intelligence-an-evangelical-statement-of-principles" nofollow>ERLC, 2019</a></span> Within human autonomy is the consequentialist
possibility that a teleological suspension of the ethical will occur and miraculously
turn out well--or, as they may phrase it, "for the glory of God"--but also the
possibility for moral culpability when ethics are conventionally violated. The
grace necessary for a teleological suspension of the ethical is not extended
beyond humanity as far as the Southern Baptists are concerned, but the need for
such a possible escape from ethical quandary is why they believe that humans (as the 
only true moral agents) must be kept in all decision-making processes: "We deny that 
humans can or should cede our moral accountability or responsibilities to any form of 
AI that will ever be created."

Setting aside for the moment that this disavowal contradicts the one ethical question
they pose to AI ("Who would Jesus run over?") it fails to acknowledge that our
Capitalist social structure has already crossed this bright line: Tim O'Reilly
claims that financial markets, which are layered over corporations that exist
in no small part to shield individuals from incidental liability for organizational
policies, <label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"><a href="http://www.gangsofamerica.com/gangsofamerica.pdf">Nace, <em>Gangs of America</em>, 2003</a></span>
qualifies as "the first rogue AI" ever since shareholder value became the
ethical standard for corporate behavior.<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tim-oreilly-algorithms-have-already-gone-rogue/">Levy, October 4, 2017</a></span>
If the Southern Baptists really want to get on good ethical footing for the future
of AI, then I should expect to hear more from them about correcting our ethics in
the status quo. Here's an opportunity: the Poor People's Campaign is challenging 
"the evils of systemic racism, poverty, the war economy, ecological devastation 
and the nation’s distorted morality" but the only Baptists partering with them are 
the Progressive National Baptist Convention.<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.poorpeoplescampaign.org/">The Poor People's Campaign</a>, <a href="https://www.poorpeoplescampaign.org/partners/">Endorsing Partners</a></span>

Overall, the broader point is that regardless of how much I may like the rhetoric
of humans not ceding moral accountability or responsibility, we're already too far 
gone from it to call it a priciple for future development.

<h2>The Trolley Problem Problem</h2>
Now let's go back to the pressing question of "Who would Jesus run over?" The fundamental
problem with the Trolley Problem as applied to autonomous vehicles is that it fails to
grasp that by the time the vehicle is in the exceptional state of being unable to avoid a
collision, <em>the vehicle is in an exceptional state</em> and should not be trusted to make good
decisions: if it were making good decisions, it likely wouldn't have gotten into this 
exceptional state.

The problem is that people are reasonably good at abstracting specific points of cause and
effect but inadequate at understanding the stream of events. As Nietzsche explains,

<blockquote>
<p>Cause and effect: such a duality probably never exists; actually, what we have here is
a continuum out of which we have isolated a few pieces; just as we always perceive motion
as isolated points, and therefore do not really see it, but infer it. The suddenness with
which many effects emerge leads us into error; but it is only sudden for us. There is an
infinite multiplicity of processes in that second of suddenness which escape us. An intellect
which could see cause and effect as a continuum, and not arbitrarily divided and dismembered
as we do, an intellect which could see the flow of events--would reject the notion of cause
and effect, and would deny all conditionality.</p>
<footer>Nietzsche, <em>The Joyous Science</em>, 1882, p. 126</footer>
</blockquote>

To put it another way, a car that has already failed to avoid a collision has already failed
so writing an algorithm to minimize damage is going to be making guesses based on suspect
inputs. If you're thinking you've seen this movie, John Carpenter's <em>Dark Star</em> (1974)
features a AI bomb that engages with phenomenology<label for="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-to-teach" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"><a href="http://www.cinemah.com/altri/war/carpent.htm">See also: cinemah.com</a></span> 
in one of the more worrying previews of how "Smart Devices" might backfire.

The problem with the Trolley Problem is that the trolley should never be in that fatalistic
situation in the first place: the contrivances required to set up the problem invalidate the
outcome and provide no meaningful guidance for real-world behavior. When forced into an
untenable situation, people try to rationalize their way out of it and reveal a desire for
a teleological suspension of the ethical--some way to know that even if they did bad that 
they didn't do wrong. In this way we still have an understanding of tragedy.

<h2>Tragedy Versus Irony</h2>
To conclude on this point I'd like to turn to Reinhold Niebuhr who writes in <em>The Irony of American History</em>
that 

<blockquote>
<p>The tragic element in a human situation is constituted of conscious choices of evil for the sake of good. If men or nations do evil in a good cause; if they cover themselves with guilt in order to fulfill some high responsibility; or if they sacrifice some high value for the sake of a higher or equal one they make a tragic choice. ... Tragedy elicits admiration as well as pity because it combines nobility with guilt.</p>
<footer>Niebuhr, <em>The Irony of American History</em>, 1952, Preface</footer>
</blockquote>

And thus the rationalizations that people inject into their answer to the Trolley Problem are
necessarily tragic. Similarly, unforeseen consequences of individual behaviors scaled up to 
organizational levels in pursuit of good goals may result in tragedy. But Niebuhr's writing 
is not focused on tragedy, it is focused on irony:

<blockquote>
<p>If virtue becomes vice through some hidden defect in the virtue; if strength becomes weakness because of the vanity to which strength may prompt the mighty man or nation; if security is transmuted into insecurity because too much reliance is placed upon it; if wisdom becomes folly because it does not know its own limits—in all such cases the situation is ironic. The ironic situation is distinguished from a pathetic one by the fact that the person involved in it bears some responsibility for it. It is differentiated from tragedy by the fact that the responsibility is related to an unconscious weakness rather than to a conscious resolution. ... if men or nations are made aware of their complicity... This realization either must lead to an abatement of the pretension, which means contrition; or it leads to a desperate accentuation of the vanities to the point where irony turns into pure evil.</p>
<footer>Niebuhr, <em>The Irony of American History</em>, 1952, Preface</footer>
</blockquote>

The worrisome thing about the Southern Baptists' statement of principles is not just
that it asserts a capacity to base codified ethics on a relgious foundation that is laced
with teleological suspensions of the ethical, but that the rote habituation of
these dogmatic principles blinds them to opportunities to engage in more
morally-relevant, ethically-sound, human-dignity-supporting behaviors in society today.
If the Southern Baptists are unable to see the irony in their assertion of principles
then the assertion addressing an imagined future must be regarded, in Niebuhr's words,
as an "accentuation of the vanities" with the consequences that entails.
